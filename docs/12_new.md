title: New (Templates)

This feature is still experimental... more than the rest of the project, I mean. It's a way to generate the skeleton of a project in a fast way. It's using the blog sample at the moment to generate the new project. You can try:

```
lpad help new
```

Check the available templates using:

```
lpad templates
```
