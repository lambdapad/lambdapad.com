Yes! Please! :-) ... you can clone, perform changes and send a pull request via Github. It's not difficult.

If you prefer to say what do you think it's missing or could be improved, please, open an issue ticket and explain as better as possible what do you need/want/desire.

In all of the cases, sponsorship the project it's possible and we'll open a sponsor section here as soon as we receive the request to be included with the payment via Github, PayPal or Patreon.
